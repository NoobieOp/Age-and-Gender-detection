# Age-and-Gender-detection

Design and implement a real-time computer vision system that can accurately detect and recognize the age and gender of individuals from a live video stream obtained from a webcam. The system will utilize pre-trained deep learning models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification to achieve the desired functionality.

Requirements:

Face Detection: Implement a face detection module that can detect faces from the live video stream. The system should be able to handle multiple faces in a single frame.

Age Estimation: Integrate a pre-trained age estimation model to predict the age group of each detected face accurately. The age groups should be classified into predefined ranges, such as '(0-2)', '(4-6)', '(8-12)', '(15-20)', '(25-32)', '(38-43)', '(48-53)', and '(60-100)'.

Gender Classification: Utilize a pre-trained gender classification model to determine the gender of each detected face as either "Male" or "Female."

Real-Time Processing: The system should operate in real-time, providing live updates of the age and gender predictions for each detected face in the video stream.

Visualization: Display the live video stream with bounding boxes around the detected faces, along with the predicted age and gender labels.

Model Loading: Implement a mechanism to load the required pre-trained models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification from specified file paths.

Performance: Optimize the system for efficient performance, ensuring smooth real-time processing without significant delays or lags.

Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios like no faces detected in a frame.
